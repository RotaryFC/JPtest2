<h1> PSALM 22 (CPDV) </h1>

<p> The LORD directs me and nothing will be lacking to me.He has settled me here, in a place of pasture. </p>

<p> He has led me out to the water of refreshment. He has converted my soul. </p>

<p> He has led me away on the paths of justice, for the sake of his name. </p>

<p> For, even if I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils. For you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they have given me consolation. </p>

<p> You have prepared a table in my sight, opposite those who trouble me. You have anointed my head with oil, and my cup, which inebriates me, how brilliant it is! </p>

<p> And your mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and so may I dwell in the house of the Lord for length of days. </p>

<h1>PSALM 116 (CPDV)</h1>

<ol>
	<li> Alleluia. All nations, praise the Lord. All peoples, praise him.</li>
	<li>For his mercy has been confirmed over us. And the truth of the Lord remains for all eternity.</li>
